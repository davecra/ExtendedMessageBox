# ExtendedMessageBox
An extended message box object that provides many more options such as a checkbox, hyperlink, automatic timed closure, and an expanded text box option.

## Summary
This was something I created a long time ago and have used in a number of projects and recently found it, expanded upon it, cleaned it up a bit and have published it here for posterity.

## This Repository
This repository contains the main library: 
 - ExtendedMessageBoxLibrary
 - ExtendedMessageBoxTestbed
 **NOTE**: The testbed project is only included to test the class library. You do not need this in your project.

## Usage
To use this project, you only need the **ExtendedMessageBoxLibrary.dll** from the BIN folder once you have compiled it. Then place it in your solution folder and add a reference to it.
Or you can include the entire project in your solution and add a reference to it.
